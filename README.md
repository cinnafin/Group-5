## Project Description
This project presents a data-driven approach to understanding crime patterns in Chicago from 2001 to 2023. By analyzing over 7 million reported crimes sourced from the Chicago Police Department, we examine spatial, temporal, and categorical crime trends. 
Using Python, Tableau, Alteryx, and various machine learning techniques, we explored how crime distribution changes over time, across geography, and in relation to arrest rates. Our analysis integrates visualization, clustering, and predictive modeling to gain deeper insights into crime behavior in Chicago.

## Research Questions and Key Findings
**Questions Explored:**
- Where are the crime "hot spots" in Chicago, and how have they shifted over time?
- Does crime exhibit seasonal trends that persist year to year?
- What is the arrest success rate across districts and wards, and how do they compare?
- Is there a correlation between location and type of crime?
- How does crime vary by time of day?
- Can we predict the likely location of a crime based on its type?


## Key Findings:
- Crime Hot Spots: We identified consistent crime hot spots concentrated in specific neighborhoods such as West Garfield Park, Englewood, and Austin. Hotspots showed some shifting patterns over decades, but certain areas remained persistently high-crime zones.
- Seasonality: Crime rates peaked during the summer months (June–August) across almost all years, with seasonal decompositions revealing a strong, repeatable pattern year over year.
- Arrest Rates: Arrest rates varied significantly by district, with some districts consistently outperforming others. Factors such as crime type and local policies likely influenced these differences.
- Location and Type Correlation: Property crimes like burglary were more geographically widespread, while violent crimes were heavily concentrated in fewer neighborhoods.
- Time of Day Patterns: Violent crimes, such as assaults and robberies, were more likely to occur late at night, while theft-related crimes peaked during the afternoon.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Using machine learning models, we achieved moderate success in predicting the likely amount of crimes for a month in a location (zipcode,ward)

  
## Application of Knowledge
The insights gleaned through this project are intended to assist law enforcement in:
- Strategically deploying patrols based on crime hot spots and time-based patterns.
- Preparing for seasonal crime fluctuations through resource planning.
- Understanding discrepancies in arrest performance across different precincts.
- Predicting the likely area of criminal activity based on limited incident information.

This research may also be extended for use in public safety planning, urban development, and policy formulation focused on crime reduction.
