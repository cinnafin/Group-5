## Project Description
This project presents a data-driven approach to understanding crime patterns in Chicago from 2001 to 2023. By analyzing over 7 million reported crimes sourced from the Chicago Police Department, we examine spatial, temporal, and categorical crime trends. 
Using Python, Tableau, Alteryx, and various machine learning techniques, we explored how crime distribution changes over time, across geography, and in relation to arrest rates. Our analysis integrates visualization, clustering, and predictive modeling to gain deeper insights into crime behavior in Chicago.

## Research Questions and Key Findings
**Questions Explored:**
- Where are the crime "hot spots" in Chicago, and how have they shifted over time?
- Does crime exhibit seasonal trends that persist year to year?
- What is the arrest success rate across districts and wards, and how do they compare?
- Is there a correlation between location and type of crime?
- How does crime vary by time of day?
- Can we predict the likely location of a crime based on its type?

**Key Findings:**
- 

## Application of Knowledge
The insights gleaned through this project are intended to assist law enforcement in:
- Strategically deploying patrols based on crime hot spots and time-based patterns.
- Preparing for seasonal crime fluctuations through resource planning.
- Understanding discrepancies in arrest performance across different precincts.
- Predicting the likely area of criminal activity based on limited incident information.

This research may also be extended for use in public safety planning, urban development, and policy formulation focused on crime reduction.
